<h1> Advent of Code 2017 </h1>

<p> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. 
They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a 
beginner who is just learning to code.
Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme. https://www.adventofcode.com</p>

<p>This repo contains my answers for the 2017 advent of code puzzles. All answers are in Java and are my own except when noted otherwise.</p>
